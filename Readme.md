# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of two CSV files, `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`, which contain headlines and news articles labeled as either `True` or `Fake`. The goal is to train a model to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

## Dataset
- `True.csv`: Contains news articles labeled as true.
- `Fake.csv`: Contains news articles labeled as fake.

## Machine Learning Model
The project uses a machine learning pipeline to:
- Preprocess the data
- Vectorize text using TF-IDF
- Train a classifier (Logistic Regression, SVM, or another)
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the code using `python fake_news_detection.py`

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which are outputted after training.
